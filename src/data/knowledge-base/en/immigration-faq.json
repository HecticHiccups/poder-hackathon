            "answer": "Do not open the door. You have the right to remain silent. Through the closed door, ask them to slide any warrant under the door. Only a judicial warrant signed by a judge gives them the right to enter. An administrative warrant (Form I-200 or I-205) does NOT give them permission to enter your home.",
            "voiceScript": "Okay, first thing—do NOT open that door. You've got rights here. Ask them through the door to slide the warrant underneath. Now here's the key part: check if it's signed by a JUDGE. If it just says 'Department of Homeland Security' or shows Form I-200, that's an administrative warrant, and they can't come in. Stay calm, don't answer questions, and call a lawyer as soon as you can.",

            "answer": "A judicial warrant is signed by a judge and gives ICE legal authority to enter your home. An administrative warrant (Form I-200 or I-205) is signed only by an ICE officer and does NOT grant them entry. Always check for a judge's signature before opening your door.",
            "voiceScript": "So there's two types of warrants, and this is super important. A judicial warrant—that's the one signed by a JUDGE—that means they can legally enter. But most of the time, ICE shows up with an administrative warrant. That's just Form I-200, signed by an ICE officer, not a judge. With an administrative warrant, you do NOT have to let them in. Look for that judge's signature. No judge? Don't open the door.",

Contact an immigration attorney immediately.",

            "voiceScript": "Say this clearly: 'I do not consent to a search.' Period. The Fourth Amendment protects you from searches without a good reason. Now, they might search anyway if they claim probable cause, but what matters is you SAID you don't consent. That's on the record. Don't ever physically resist though—that'll just make things worse.

It's called a 'self-help eviction' and it's not allowed anywhere in the U.S. Call 911 right away—tell them it's an illegal lockout. Take photos of everything.

This documentation is crucial for legal action.",

Plus, you need to either be in school, have graduated, or served in the military. If you qualify, DACA gives you a work permit and protection from deportation—though it's temporary, you have to renew it. It's not a path to citizenship, but it's real protection.",
