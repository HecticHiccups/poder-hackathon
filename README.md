# PODER 🔥

**Reclaiming Rights. Empowering People.**

> *"Poder"* means "Power" in Spanish. We believe knowledge is power—and we're giving it back.

---

## The Problem

**Critical rights information is disappearing.** Government websites are removing, burying, or obscuring information that people need to protect themselves. Meanwhile:

- **Legal jargon is inaccessible** — Most people can't understand their rights even when they find them
- **Language barriers persist** — Non-English speakers are left behind
- **Fear breeds compliance** — Without knowing their rights, people waive them
- **Education is boring** — Nobody wants to read dense legal documents

**The result:** Vulnerable communities—immigrants, tenants, workers—are exploited because they don't know they have power.

---

## Our Solution

**Poder** is a mobile-first educational platform that:

1. 📜 **Archives** — Recovers and preserves rights information from government sources
2. 🧠 **Simplifies** — Transforms legal jargon into plain, actionable language
3. 🌍 **Translates** — Delivers content in any language you speak
4. 🎮 **Gamifies** — Makes learning your rights engaging through interactive simulations
